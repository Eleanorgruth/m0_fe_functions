# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
 - Time management is an area I need to improve. In college I always said "there aren't enough hours in the day." I'm right back to that familiar feeling. I think that I take longer to absorb info compared to my peers but this makes it challenging to know when to move on, or accept that I will not develop expertise in a single lesson. I need to go back to calendaring and really continue to monitor my time.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
  - A function is a package of instructions that you write. To get the result you have to invoke the instructions that you wrote. But once you write them once it is easy to follow them again.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
  - Arguments and parameters can add more/different information to a function each time the function is called.
    - A parameter is similar to a variable. It must be in the declaration/definition of the function. It uses camelCase. An example could be (firstName, favoriteNumber, workingHard).
    - A argument is the actual data passed into the function when you invoke or call the function. The format is ("String", Number, Boolean) or ("Eleanor", 1, true).
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
 -  It seems like a function can also store data, so when would you use a function over an Array or Objects? Or (I'm afraid to ask) could you put an array or objects into a function?
